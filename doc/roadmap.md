# To be done
If you want to help please contact us in discord.
-
- Extend Mobile wallet with additional functionality. 
- Non-interactive transaction scheme (NIT). Q4-2022
- trustless aggregators system for transactions obfuscation
- Mobile node.
- Switch from binaries to library model (required for iOS support).  
- Multisig.
- Minimize transactions traceability (Coinjoin pool)
- Hardware wallets. Requires hardware manufacturer support.

There are many potential places development resources can be allocated. They will be chosen based on market needs. Highest priority will be given to requests that primarily benefit and come from the buyers and hodlers of last resort.
