The MWC network was launched in November 2019 and has functioned flawlessly with 100% uptime. The MWC Team considers the protocol ossified and currently sees no need for a future hard or soft fork unless a defensive action were required to protect the network.

MWC development is progressing well and there are many areas where development resources could be allocated.

This roadmap will show you where MWC has been and plans to go. If you are a skilled developer then please jump in and help make it happen!

# Completed
- BTC/MWC atomic swap on testnet.
- 11/11/2019 Mainnet launch.
- 01/02/2020 Airdrop concluded. About 5,400,037 MWC claimed and 599,963 unclaimed.
- 2,599,963 MWC moved to a verifiable escrow wallets for HODL program and unclaimed airdrop.
- MWC QT wallet cold storage implementation.
- 01/21/2020 GRIN CVE patched.
- Grin 3.0 rebase.
- Transaction pool update.
- HODL Program Registration Wallet.

# Near term (0-3 months)
- HODL program first payment - wallet support + backend.
- MWCMQS support in mwc-wallet.
- Start work on Mobile wallet.
- Additional Grin rebases (if applicable).

# Medium term (3-6 months)
- Website content.
- Email list updates.
- Website notifications.
- BTC/MWC atomic swaps.
  - QT wallet integration.
  - MWC 713 integration.
- Block explorer updates.

# Long term (6+ months depending on priority)
- Decentralized exchange.
- Mobile wallet.
- Multisig.
- Lightning network.
- Coin shuffle.
- Hardware wallets but requires hardware manufacturer support.

The exact details of the HODL Program have still not been decided. At least 55% of the 2,000,000 MWC in the HODL Program will be distributed to holders that have MWC that has not been moved after block 212,580.

If there is any fork that does not have the consensus of the MWC developer team then any outputs created on any fork that are associated with either the HODL Program or the Unclaimed Airdrop Program will either be burned or added to the developer fund on those fork(s).

There are many potential places development resources can be allocated. They will be chosen based on market needs. Highest priority will be given to requests that primarily benefit and come from the buyers and hodlers of last resort.

Almost since its beginning MWC has encountered very sophisticated heavily funded attacks by various mining consortiums who have attempted to destroy the network. Consequently, while the friendly miners are greatly appreciated the operating assumption is that miners are actively hostile and malicious towards the long-term interests of the buyers and hodlers of last resort and the network.

By November 2020 MWC will be the only major coin on the C31 algorithm. Certain off-the-shelf GPUs perform C31 efficiently relative to other algorithms. The MWC Team is aware of C31 ASIC designs that were done but abandoned by Obelisk and Innosilicon. The MWC Team will only take defensive measures, like a hard fork proof of work change, to protect the network against ASICs being used in a malicious or disruptive way.
