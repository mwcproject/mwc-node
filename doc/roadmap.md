The MWC network has been functioning flawlessly since launch with 100% uptime. The MWC Team considers the protocol ossified with no need for a future hard fork unless a defensive action were required to protect the network.

MWC development is progressing well and there are many areas where development resources could be allocated.

This roadmap will show you where MWC has been and plans to go. If you are a skilled developer then please jump in and help make it happen!

# Completed
- BTC/MWC atomic swap on testnet.
- 11/11/2019 Mainnet launch.
- 01/02/2020 Airdrop concluded. About 5,400,037 MWC claimed and 599,963 unclaimed.
- 2,599,963 MWC moved to a verifiable escrow wallets for HODL program and unclaimed airdrop.
- MWC QT wallet cold storage implementation.
- 01/21/2020 GRIN CVE patched.
- Grin 3.0 rebase.
- Transaction pool update.
- HODL Program Registration Wallet.

# Near term (0-3 months)
- HODL program first payment - wallet support + backend.
- MWCMQS support in mwc-wallet.
- Start work on Mobile wallet.
- Additional Grin rebases (if applicable).

# Medium term (3-6 months)
- Website content.
- Email list updates.
- Website notifications.
- BTC/MWC atomic swaps.
  - QT wallet integration.
  - MWC 713 integration.
- Block explorer updates.

# Long term (6+ months depending on priority)
- Decentralized exchange.
- Mobile wallet.
- Multisig.
- Lightning network.
- Coin shuffle.
- Hardware wallets but requires hardware manufacturer support.

The exact details of the HODL Program have still not been decided but at least 50% of the MWC in the HODL Program will be distributed to holders that have MWC that has not been moved after block 202,500.

If there is any fork that does not have the consensus of the MWC developer team then any outputs created on any fork that are associated with either the HODL Program or the Unclaimed Airdrop Program will either be burned or added to the developer fund on those fork(s).

There are many potential places development resources can be allocated and they will be chosen based on market needs with highest priority given to requests that will primarily benefit and come from the buyers and hodlers of last resort.

Almost since its beginning MWC has encountered very sophisticated heavily funded attacks by various mining consortiums who have attempted to destroy the network. Consequently, while the friendly miners are greatly appreciated the operating assumption is that miners are actively hostile and malicious towards the long-term interests of the buyers and hodlers of last resort and the network.

MWC will be the only major coin on the C31 algorithm by November 2020 and certain off-the-shelf GPUs perform C31 efficiently relative to other algorithms. The MWC Team is aware of C31 ASIC designs that were done but abandoned by Obelisk and Innosilicon. The MWC Team would only take defensive measures like a hard fork proof of work change to protect the network against the use of ASICs in malicious and disruptive way.
